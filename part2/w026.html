    <p>Did you know why we use 'const' to create state variables in React.js instead of using 'let' or 'var' ?

        ```
        const [state, setState] = useState(); // why 'const' ?
        ```
        
        The reason for using 'const' is that if we use 'let' or 'var', the state variable can be changed directly with the assignment operator. In React, state variables should only be updated using the setState() function.
        
        React only tracks state variables when they are updated using the setState() function. This means that if the state variable is updated directly, React will not show the updated data on the UI, even though the value of the state variable has changed internally.
        
        That is why we use 'const' for creating state variables in React. It prevents fellow developers from updating state directly. Therefore, it is recommended to use 'const' for creating state variables.
        
        Using 'const' ensures -
        1. Immutability of Reference
        2. Code Clarity

        <p>From helping put man on the moon üåï to enabling global companies to achieve the impossible üåç, IBM‚Äôs legacy is nothing short of extraordinary. Today, I am incredibly grateful to become a small part of this storied history as I join IBM as a summer intern.

            I am proud to share that I am now officially an IBMer. The past two weeks of workshops and training have been an incredible learning experience, preparing me for the journey ahead.
            
            What I‚Äôve learned thus far:
            
             üí° The power of design thinking: Understanding how to approach problems with a user-centric mindset has been eye-opening and is a testament to IBM‚Äôs commitment to innovation.
             ü§ù The essence of teamwork: Collaborating with diverse teams has highlighted the importance of different perspectives and the strength that comes from unity.
             ü§ñ The role of technology and AI: Gaining insights into how AI and cutting-edge technologies can solve complex business challenges has been both exciting and inspiring.
             üîÑ Adaptability: In an ever-changing world, IBM‚Äôs ability to continually adapt and innovate proves its resilience and forward-thinking approach. This adaptability is a core value that I am eager to embrace and contribute to.
            
            But the most important thing I have noticed so far is getting to know the diverse people at IBM. From coffee breaks ‚òï to small chats, getting to know my fellow interns and the seasoned IBMers has made me even more excited about what‚Äôs to come!
            
            As I continue this exciting journey, I look forward to contributing to impactful projects and upholding IBM‚Äôs legacy of excellence. Here‚Äôs to many more weeks of growth, learning, and making a difference!</p>
